Title: General RAP Functions For ASD
Description: This package is used to collect all general RAP functions to be used and shared internally. This is separate to the public "RAP_code_library" (which has a higher threshold for QA), and everyone is encouraged to contribute to this to share ideas without the same QA overhead.
